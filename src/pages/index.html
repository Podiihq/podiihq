  <h1>How we work</h1>
  <p>
    We involve the client throughout the process just to make sure things are
    moving in the right direction with the correct speed, we never get into a
    hole and emerge with a final product. We also properly test our code to
    reduce errors that might occur and check teammates' work to ensure software
    is maintainable in the long run
  </p>

    <h2 class="left-header">Sprint planning to ensure we are working on the
      right thing</h2>
    <img alt="sprint planning" class="right"
      src="{{root}}assets/img/how-we-work/sprint.png" />
    <p>
      In sprint planning meeting, we determine how much work can realistically
      be accomplished during the sprint and the product owner has the final say
      on what criteria needs to be met for the work to be approved and accepted.
      Our sprint meetings are typically every two weeks but can be weekly or
      monthly depending on urgency and volatility of the project
    </p>

    <img alt="testing software" class="left"
      src="{{root}}assets/img/how-we-work/test.png" />
    <p>
      The testing process is an important phase when we develop software. It's a
      software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an
      application are individually and independently scrutinized for proper
      operation.

    <h2 class="left-header">Code Review to reduce errors</h2>
    <img alt="reviewing software" class="right"
      src="{{root}}assets/img/how-we-work/review.png" />
    <p>
      Code review is a software quality assurance activity in which our team of
      software developers check the program mainly by viewing and reading parts
      of its source code after implementation.We use code review for validating
      the design and implementation of features requested by clients
    </p>

    <h2 class="right-header">Dedicated hours for bug hunting and solving </h2>
    <img alt="bug fixing" class="left"
      src="{{root}}assets/img/how-we-work/bug.png" />
    <p>
      We have a day specifically set to dedicate our time in solving these
      errors. We fix bugs as soon as we can because; unfixed bugs camouflage
      other bugs, provide proof of poor quality, to avoid wasting time
      discussing unfixed bugs, to avoid distracting and disorienting the entire
      team and to avoid having us look unprofessional by providing inaccurate
      estimates.

          We have been able to work with a variety of applications ranging from
          those that require realtime updates, to applications that work on
          flaky
          intenet connection or some without internet connectivity
        </p>
        <p>
          Mobile payments and micropayments have been in the rise too and we
          have build applications that enable organisations to allow their
          members to ask for loans and pay in installments. It has also been
          possible for the organisations to make payments straight to the mobile
          phones
