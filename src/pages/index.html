  <h1>How we work</h1>
  <p>
    We  involve the client throughout the process just to make sure things are moving in the right direction with the correct speed, we never get into a hole and emerge with a final product. We also properly test our code to reduce errors that might occur and check teammates' work to ensure software is maintainable in the long run
  </p>

  <h2>Sprint planning to ensure we are working on the right thing</h2>
  <img alt="sprint planning"  src="{{root}}assets/img/how-we-work/sprint.png"/>
  <p>
    In sprint planning meeting, we  determine how much work can realistically be accomplished during the sprint and the product owner has the final say on what criteria needs to be met for the work to be approved and accepted. Our sprint meetings are typically every two weeks but can be weekly or monthly depending on urgency and volatility of the project

  <h2>Testing code to reduce regression failures </h2>
  <img alt="testing software"  src="{{root}}assets/img/how-we-work/test.png"/>
  <p>
    The testing process is an important phase when we develop software.  It's a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation.

  <h2>Code Review to reduce errors</h2>
  <img alt="reviewing software"  src="{{root}}assets/img/how-we-work/review.png"/>
  <p>
    Code review is a software quality assurance activity in which our team of software developers check the program mainly by viewing and reading parts of its source code after implementation.We use code review for validating the design and implementation of features requested by clients

  <h2>Dedicated hours for bug hunting and solving </h2>
  <img alt="bug fixing"  src="{{root}}assets/img/how-we-work/bug.png"/>
  <p>
    We have a day specifically set to dedicate our time in solving these errors. We fix bugs as soon as we can because; unfixed bugs camouflage other bugs, provide proof of poor quality, to avoid wasting time discussing unfixed bugs, to avoid distracting and disorienting the entire team and to avoid having us look unprofessional by providing inaccurate estimates.
