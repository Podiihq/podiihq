          This is an awesome caption to show how good we are at the tech stuff :)
          What if people had quirks what would you go for; half cold, half hot 
          or a one for all quirk. 
        </p>
          <p>This quirk gives you superstrength and superfast 
          speed.There is erasure which enables one to temporarily erase one's 
          quirk during combat.That aside in the villains side you may have a  quirk
          called decay that turns anything you touch into ash ...

        <p>This is just giberish text :: yeah, because it decays...it decays thats 
        its called decay...decay.there is also another one that similar to one for all
        but also has other one's inherited with it.
        </p>
        <p>
        This quirk allows one to regenerate
        any part of the body if damaged,absorb and release but also has defect that 
        the holder becomes doll-like that is superdumb and cannot speak..crazy isnt it
